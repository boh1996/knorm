Knorm is inspired by the [Mongoose JS](http://mongoosejs.com/) and
[Bookshelf.js](http://bookshelfjs.org/) APIs. It was previously a built as a
wrapper around [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org), hence the kn-orm name i.e. knex-orm;
but it now builds it's own SQL via [SQL Bricks.js](http://csnw.github.io/sql-bricks/).
